Condemned from a false pretense by the product of hope
We blindly let them lead us
Condemned from a false pretense by the product of hope
We blindly let them lead us

Let go of the life you know
Chances are, we aren't coming back

Commander, approach the podium
We the people have rallied under our flag
Standing proud, you rid us of our fate
Behind the gun, you're given all our faith
Now we march to the pulse of the beating war drum
Say goodnight and follow the setting sun

Agendas of sovereignty
Masked by the mirage of hope and change
Our lady of liberty
Falls down to her knees, bound and gagged
The hammer of judgment falls on you
The hammer of judgment falls on you

I will never trust a man with the power of God
A brainwashed mind with full control
I will never trust a man with the power of God

Release the grip that binds us all
To a cold, quick doom six feet deep
You don't have the bullets to kill us all
We find ourselves backed into the wall
No one at our side
Never looking back, we're ready to die

Sealing the future in its shallow grave
The dreams of man crushed within your grip
Empires fall as your reign meets its end
I stood still among the riled crowd
Our eyes met and you knew
I'd be the one to take you out
Nightmares can't warn you of the evil winds
That are blowing your way

Call to arms to stand by my side
Our leaders have failed us
Take it back, gun them down heartlessly
Our leaders have failed us
