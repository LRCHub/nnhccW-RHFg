You know there are some times
You have to let go of all your humanity
Just to fulfill the mission, you gotta be a monster
Just so your loved ones can remain human
Picture a moment you made me wanna hurt you
And study these upcoming seconds, homie, I encourage you
Disarming a bully is something I have learned to love
So forgive me if I accidentally merk you
Shins, knees, achilles, I kick 'em, then break 'em freely
The snappin' of elbows, really, a freebie to what I'm seekin'
I just need to hear you screamin'
Forgive me, there is no reason'
No PTSD, no demon 'cause I am the beast thats feedin', I'll
Still be fuckin' starvin' after eatin' out your heart
I'ma check out on your liver, while yo' lungs up in a cart
Skin you up and design you to hang on walls beside the darts
I personally think I'm puttin' some salt on the other parts
Just to listen to the fizzin' of your inner skin'
Inchin' to keep you livin' to witness 'til your bitter end
Huh, I don't know if you hissin' to all ya little friends
Yeah, they indifferent as shit whenever you middle-man
I can walk up to the podium
And show them, I ain't jokin', man
Why you talkin' 'bout me?
Better quit it, hold it all, I'll toast ya
I am known for leavin' no one out my scope
When they be walkin' to the podium
And show them, I ain't jokin', man
Why you talkin' 'bout me?
Better quit it, hold it all, I'll toast ya
Then they'll post ya, huh
An unfortunate reality
Media gon' be after me if I actually do let out
Just a portion of my insanity
I would rather rap on a slap and them smack a gat in your eye
If you was one of those cats who was talkin smack to me now
Y'all still laughed at me even through all the tragedy
Learnin' that it's a corporate play to score off a rapper beef, huh?
Forth and back we go to rappin' 'bout the action we on
Then it's a wrap, they gon' decide on who's gazelle or lion
But it's unfair if I decide to score a place
When I'm the one who brought us out the horror days?
But I don't need to be credited 'cause I got more ways to
Zippin' you up in a bag just because of pure rage
My technique is indefinite with the war-play
Apex-predator huntin', straight out of your cage
Melodical Killaz runnin' with me all day
Know is to get to business in hopes to get some more pay
Long day, strategizing, hit, listen to Conway
Hittin' heads in a target got you scared how this arm race
I could have a sling and kill all you chickens from long range
This .30 extendo itchin to pop it off your face
All mace, that's the shit you be sprayin', you all fakes, all cakes
Bitch, don't think that I'm playin'
There's no breaks, snowflakes
See, I'll keep the sachets if you won't pay, pro-baked
I'm a walkin' distillery
And I bet that I can walk up to the podium
And show them (I'ma show them), I ain't jokin', man
Why you talkin' 'bout me?
Better quit it, hold it all, I'll toast ya
I am known for leavin' no one out my scope
When they be walkin' to the podium
And show them (I'ma show them), I ain't jokin', man
Why you talkin' 'bout me?
Better quit it, hold it all, I'll toast ya (Boom)
Then they'll post ya, huh
